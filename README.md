# PythonBasic

Greetings.
I am Zion, and I maintain the repository PythonBasic.
I upload projects that I make out of a hobby onto the repository, and you can build on top of it to your liking, as long as you credit me that is.
All projects on this repository work completely fine and are very very basic and easy to understand, I've even added a couple of comments so you understand whats going on.

If you want to contact me for whatever reason, my Discord is always open:
